### provide a humanly readable list of key - value items in nested jsons
When accessing the `<domain_name>/jsonapi` endpoint of a CMS (Drupal in this case) the answer is a quite complex json.
For testing purposes, it has been saved as a file in `./data/jsonapi.json`
There's also the file `./data/nodepage.json` - it's the saved response of the `<domain_name>/jsonapi/node/page` endpoint
